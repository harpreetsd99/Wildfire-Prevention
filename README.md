# Wildfire-Prevention
Data Visualization using Power BI to understand different causes and ways to prevent wildfire in Canada. The project deep-dives into Canada's wildfire crisis, exploring causes, impacts, and solutions. It pinpoints human activity, climate change, and forest management as key culprits, urging a holistic approach. The call is for collective action - proactive measures, implemented recommendations, and wildfire awareness - to shield communities and forests.

* But hope exists! Preventative burns, swift detection, and sustainable forestry lessen the wildfire threat.
* Together, with awareness and responsibility, we can shield our forests, homes, and futures from fire's fury
